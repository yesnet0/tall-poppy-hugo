Tall Poppy Group partners with the builders and leaders shaping the future of cybersecurity. We build, advise, and invest in companies driving advances in offensive research, threat intelligence, practitioner-led defense, and policy - with a focus on real-world impact and technical excellence.

## Why we exist

Cybersecurity problems require builders who have lived them. Our founder, Casey - a cybersecurity specialist, entrepreneur, company founder, policy advocate, keynote speaker, advisor, investor, husband, and dad - knows that deep domain experience and an unrelenting focus on operational realities produce the strongest outcomes. Tall Poppy Group exists to help those practitioners scale their ideas into enduring companies.

## What we back

We back technical founders and teams who combine rigorous research with hands-on operational experience - whether they're exposing adversary tradecraft, transforming intelligence into action, or designing defensive tooling grounded in practitioner workflows. We also invest in ventures that influence the policy and regulatory landscape to create safer, more resilient ecosystems.

## How we work

Our approach is active and collaborative. We bring capital, but we also roll up our sleeves: advising on product strategy, go-to-market, researcher-to-customer translation, and recruiting mission-critical talent. We help founders crystallize vision into roadmap, navigate complex threat and policy environments, and connect to a network of operators, customers, and fellow founders.

## We're partners for the long run

Tall Poppy Group measures success by the durability of the teams and technologies we support. We invest with conviction, mentor with candor, and advocate for solutions that scale securely and ethically. If you're a founder turning deep technical insight into a company that changes how defenders and policymakers think about risk, we should talk.
