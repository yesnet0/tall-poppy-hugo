We build, back, and advise the companies making cybersecurity actually work. Whether we're creating something from scratch or partnering with founders, our focus is the same: turning deep technical expertise into ventures that shift the advantage toward defenders.

## Why We Exist

Security's hardest problems don't get solved in boardrooms. They get solved by practitioners who've spent years in the trenches: hunting adversaries, building defenses, shaping policy. These experts often have the clearest vision for what needs to exist but lack the infrastructure to build it at scale.

Sometimes we find those founders and back them. Sometimes we build it ourselves. Either way, we're here to turn operational insight into durable companies.

## What We Do

**Build:** We create companies and products where we see critical gaps in the market. When the right solution doesn't exist and we have the expertise to make it, we build it.

**Back:** We invest in founders combining rigorous research with real-world operational experience. Teams working on adversary tradecraft, threat intelligence, defensive tooling, and security policy.

**Advise:** We work hands-on with technical founders to translate depth into business clarity, helping with product development, go-to-market, talent, and the relationships that matter.

## How We Work

We're practitioners first. That shapes everything: what we choose to build, who we back, how we advise. We don't sit on the sidelines. We get in the weeds on product, strategy, and execution because we've done it ourselves.

We measure success in years, not quarters. Whether we're building a company or backing one, we stay engaged through the hard parts and push for solutions that are both scalable and ethical. Defenders and policymakers face real risk. We build and invest in companies that help them win.
