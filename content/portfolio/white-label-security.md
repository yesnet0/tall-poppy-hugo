## About White Label Security

White Label Security (2010-2013) productized penetration testing and security assessments for the MSP channel. The thesis: most small IT shops couldn't afford to hire pentesters, but their clients needed security services. WLS provided a turnkey platform (branding, scoping tools, report templates, and a network of vetted testers) so MSPs could resell security under their own name.

The company proved the model worked. MSPs bought it, their clients valued it, and the security talent showed up. WLS was, in hindsight, an unwitting prototype for Bugcrowd.

## The Platform

- Turnkey pentest-as-a-service platform for MSP resale
- White-labeled reports, scoping questionnaires, and client portals
- Contractor network management and quality control systems
- PCI DSS and HIPAA compliance assessment workflows

## The Bugcrowd Connection

WLS validated two things that became foundational to Bugcrowd: enterprises would pay for outsourced security testing, and skilled researchers existed in abundance but were poorly connected to opportunities. The difference was scale. WLS coordinated testers top-down; Bugcrowd let researchers self-select into programs. Same insight, different execution. The crowdsourced model unlocked global scale.

Bugcrowd launched the following year.
