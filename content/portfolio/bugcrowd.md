## About Bugcrowd

The hacker community has always been full of people who think like criminals but have a core conviction not to cause harm. Ordinary individuals with extraordinary skills, and the world sees them as threats. Bugcrowd was built to bridge that disconnect: connecting those who can help with those who need help.

Attackers are creative, driven, and persistent. A small security team cannot defend against multiple diverse adversaries coming from all angles. Defenders need an army of allies. Bugcrowd provides one.

Today, over 100 crowdsourced security platforms operate globally. Bugcrowd created the industry.

## The Platform

- The platform that created the bug bounty industry
- Global network of security researchers who self-select into programs
- Vulnerability disclosure programs adopted by Fortune 500s and governments
- Penetration testing at crowd scale
- Attack surface management powered by human intelligence

## The Thesis

White Label Security proved enterprises would pay for outsourced security testing and that skilled researchers existed in abundance. The limitation was coordination. Managing contractors top-down didn't scale.

Bugcrowd inverted the model. Instead of assigning testers to programs, researchers choose their targets. The crowd self-organizes around opportunity. Same insight as WLS, different execution, and the crowdsourced model unlocked global scale.
